### Project Description
This project combines interactive name inputs and a pulsating heart animation to calculate and display a fun "love percentage" based on the names entered by the user. It brings a whimsical, personalized experience, enhanced with background music and a candyhouse font.

### The Problem Statement
Ever wondered how much you "love" someone based solely on your names? This project solves the age-old problem of calculating love through random name-based algorithms, turning it into a fun and playful activity!

### The Solution
We're solving it with a pulsating heart that shows your love percentage based on your names. The heart beats to the rhythm of the names you type, all while background music plays to set the mood. Add a sprinkle of fun, and you've got the perfect love calculator!
